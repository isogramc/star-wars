# Star Wars

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.3.

## The Brief

Links used to accomplish this assignment:

[Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/)

[Figma Designs](https://www.figma.com/file/Eq2Dxscp7ylJq9osa0XoYl/Star-Wars-Assignment?node-id=0%3A1)

[Star Wars Font](https://www.fontspace.com/starjedi-special-edition-font-f9644)


This application displays the following pages:


1. Film listing page

2. Film detail page

3. Character detail page

4. An additional listing page of your choice

5. An additional detail page of your choice


For 4 and 5, choose from any of the following API resources: planets, species, starships or vehicles. Create a listing and detail page for your resource, just like you did for 1 and 2. On the details page, show a list of films in which the item starred, and link back to the films detail page.

- [x] *I chose planets and this links to a planets detail page*


### Write a unit test for the film listing page.
The unit tests have been created.

### Interactions
 - [x] The Star Wars header text links to the films listing page.

 - [x] Clicking on a row in any listing page, navigates to the corresponding detail page.

 - [x] Clicking on the character name in the film detail page, navigates to the character detail page.

 - [x] Clicking on the film link on your chosen detail page, navigates to the film details page.

### Features
- [x] Listing pages should be paginatable, using whatever paging size the SWAPI returns.

- [x] Pages should be responsive, as indicated in the Figma design.

### Tech Stack
- [x] We would like to challenge you a bit, and see some Angular and TypeScript skills, so stick to those.

- [x] Try your best to avoid using any CSS frameworks, we'd like to see you roll your own stylesheets.

- [x] Commit your code to a Git service, GitLab, GitHub or BitBucket, the choice is yours.

### Time Limit
Not everybody works at the same pace, or even with the same technique. We'd like you to estimate how long you think the assignment will take you, and let us know up front. A couple of days, and perhaps a weekend should be enough.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
